   Mark Worden at TWR,
   Stuart Pearce at Oregon State University/OOI, and
   Anatoli Erofeev at Oregon State University

<!--
   Basic Flow:
     Reset to using primary phone number on the next call in
     Transfer files in to-glider to the glider via dockzr, then reload ma files if needed
     Receive files from glider and put in from-glider
     Transfer files in to-science to the glider via dockszr
     Request device info
     Transfer files in to-glider to the glider via dockzr, then reload ma files if needed
     Resume the mission

   There is special handling in the case of a failure to reload the ma files.
   On the next callin a control-F will be issued regardless of if new ma files are sent or not.

   There is also special handling for no science logging is present, i.e. a pocket simulator

   Works with Iridium, Freewave, or direct connected gliders

   For use with SFMC dockserver version 8.x and up

   State names are constructed like:
      T0VerDockzr

      where:
        T0 indicates the thread, with T0 being the main thread,
        T1 indicates ma files need to be reloaded,

        Ver is the action being undertaken,
          Ver->verify a command was received,
          Snd->Send a command,
          Wait->Wait for a command to finish

        Dockzr is the related command,
           Put, Dockzr, Dockszr, Send, DeviceInfo, Resume, ReloadMA, ...
    
Note: This script has transitions based on loss of Carrier Detect.  
      It may not behave correctly with communications that do NOT support Carrier Detect.

Note: I dropped Mark Worden's initial dockzr and dockszr on startup 
      since we do that pre-deployment or manually.

<!--
   This script has been tested on an SFMC with:
      A pocket simulator running 8.x
      A shoebox simulator running 8.x
      G3 deep gliders with 8.x
      G2 shallow glider with 8.x

        This state waits for the glider to disconnect and then goes to the script's first state
        in preparation for the glider's next surfacing.
        The text "Connection Event: Carrier Detect lost." is always the last text seen when a
        glider disconnects. Since this state matches that text before going to the script's first
        state, the glider's console output as seen by the script is cleared before looping back
        to the first state. This helps prevent some spurious glider output to cause a premature
        zModem transfer - premature in the sense that the glider has not yet dovei and
        later resurfaced.
